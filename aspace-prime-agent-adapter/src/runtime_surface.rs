//! The Python runtime as a surface — re-pointed, never a second daemon.
//!
//! A2: the runtime Python (`prime-agent-runtime/`, uv, `pyproject.toml`)
//! is the REPL / the kernel Python — the persistent REPL where the
//! agent's code runs (`python_repl`, `ipython`, venv). The fusion
//! composes the Rust (the H1 engine); the Python runtime is the
//! surface of the REPL, re-pointed at the single daemon — as the
//! Python server of agent-zero was re-pointed at pas 5 — and never a
//! second daemon (H-F8-2).
//!
//! The surface contract: which paths are the surface, which
//! environment variables decide its behaviour, and what it is
//! re-pointed at. There is no spawn path in this module: the surface
//! is data, checked, not launched.
